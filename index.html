            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>The little, local theater is not enough for Buster Moon, voiced by Matthew McConaughey. He and the team: Meena (Tori Kelly), Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), Johnny (Taron Egerton), Ash (Scarlet Johansson), Gunter (Nick Kroll), and Mr. Moon's trusty, century-old assistant, Miss Crawly (Garth Jennings), try to go big in showbusiness. When an entertainment company's agent turns them down, they go to Redshore city, a mix between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, to persuade the manager in person.</p>

            <p>The team get a deal, but with one condition, they must get Clay Calloway (Bono) out of retirement and into the show. Full plot summary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6467266/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl" target="_blank">here</a></p>

            <p>The sequel to Sing, Sing 2 includes many songs. 19 to be precise, which is a lot for a 2-hour movie. Some of the most popular include <i>Your Song Saved my Life</i> by U2, <i>I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</i> by Bono and <i>Bad Guy</i> by Billie Eilish.</p>
            <p>The songs are really well integrated into the story and overall movie. All of the songs are performed by the original cast. Sometimes, in my opinion, the Sing 2 covers of songs are better than the original. The movie is so packed with songs, that it may obstruct the story for some viewers. The cast bring new energy to all of the songs and make the movie more lively</p>

            <h2>Verdict</h2>
            <p><i>Sing 2</i> is a great family movie, with many songs. The stroy could get improvement, but combined with the songs, the movie will seem seamless. <i>Sing 2</i> has more songs than any in-depth morale, but if you enjoyed <i>Sing</i>, then chances are that you will enjoy the second as well!</p>
